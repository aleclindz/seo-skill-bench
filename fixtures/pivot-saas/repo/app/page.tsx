          Lumina is the AI meeting assistant for teams. It joins your calls, records and
          transcribes them, and delivers a summary with decisions and action items before
          you&apos;re back at your desk.

          Connect your calendar once. Lumina joins every meeting you invite it to — Zoom,
          Meet, or Teams — and does the busywork humans shouldn&apos;t.
